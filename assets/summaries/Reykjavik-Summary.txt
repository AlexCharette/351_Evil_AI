Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, is a cozy harbor town named after the steam rising from the strong geothermal activity of the area.
Enjoy a typical Icelandic hot dog, rotten shark and strong alcohol, or just the strong alcohol!
One of Iceland's most beautiful areas, the Golden Circle, is located just 45 minutes out of the city by car, so make a day trip of it!
